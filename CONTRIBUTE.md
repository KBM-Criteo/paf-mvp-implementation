# OneKey: contribute to the implementation project

## Dependencies

Each subdirectory contains a `package.json` that _should_ be updated to enable extracting each project in the future,
but the only one that **must** be kept up to date is [the root package.json](package.json).

## Versions

- for **node** version, see [.nvmrc](.nvmrc)
- for **typescript** version, see [package.json](package.json)
